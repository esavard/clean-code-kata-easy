# clean-code-kata-easy
Easy code kata to practice clean coding.

## Proposed exercises (to be done in 15–30 min)

1. Add a first unit test for function “c” in its initial “dirty” state
2. Propose clear names and a clear signature
3. Identify multiple responsibilities
4. Handle exceptions (division by 0)
5. Refactor (for example: add an enum, one operation per unit test SRP)
6. Bonus: Use the Strategy and Factory design patterns to make the code easier to maintain

**Tips:**
* At each step, make sure to improve your tests *BEFORE* writing new code or refactoring existing code (red, green, refactor).
* The linter is your “friend” and can show you how to take advantage of language features (e.g.: use when instead of nested if…else in Kotlin).

## How to run the tests
### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Make sure you have the Kotlin plugin installed.
3. Run the tests by right-clicking on the test file and selecting "Run 'All Tests'".
4. You can also run individual tests by right-clicking on the test method and selecting "Run".
5. To run the application, right-click on the main function in the `Main.kt` file and select "Run 'MainKt'".

Happy coding!
